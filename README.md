This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Google Sign-In Setup

To enable signing up / logging in with Google, add the following environment variables to your server environment (for local development, put them in your `.env`):

- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret

How to create credentials:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID (choose Web application)
3. Add authorized redirect URI(s) — for local development this typically is `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` or follow your auth library docs
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into your env

After setting the env variables, restart the dev server.
